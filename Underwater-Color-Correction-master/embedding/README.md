## Latent variable testing

This directory contains tests for looking into the latent space of
the generator. There should be two directories here, 'clean' and
'distorted'. The clean images are underwater images that do not
contain distortion, and the distorted images are the distorted PAIRS
generated by CycleGAN. So the two folders must match up.

### Goal

The goal here is to enter both a clean and distorted image in the model,
extract their embedding, then interpolate. Hopefully we will see a smooth
color change.
