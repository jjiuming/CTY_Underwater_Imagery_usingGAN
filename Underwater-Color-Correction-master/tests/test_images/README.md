So `ugan_0.0/`, `ugan_1.0/`, and `original/` folders have the 1813 images
from imagenet that I am testing on. These are NOT to be compared with CycleGAN
because these are what CycleGAN trained on.

The `flickr/` folder contains images downloaded from flickr that are close to
our test set. I am going to test on these when comparing to CycleGAN. The results
of training on flickr for unet are in ugan_fl*
